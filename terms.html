<div class="space-y-4 text-body text-grey-700">
<p>Oasis International Cleaning Services Ltd ("we", "our", "us") provides professional cleaning services across London, including residential, commercial, deep cleaning, end of tenancy, and specialist cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Service Scope:</strong> Services are provided as described in your quote or service agreement. We reserve the right to refuse or modify services if safety concerns, access issues, or other factors make it impractical to proceed as originally planned.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Service Standards:</strong> We undertake to provide services with reasonable skill and care, using appropriate equipment and eco-friendly products. All staff are vetted, trained, and insured.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Variations:</strong> If you require additional services beyond the agreed scope, additional charges will apply. We'll discuss and agree these with you before proceeding.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="text-h2 text-grey-900 mb-6">2. Booking and Cancellation</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 text-body text-grey-700">
<p><strong>2.1 Booking Confirmation:</strong> Bookings are confirmed once you accept our quote and we acknowledge receipt. For regular services, confirmation covers the agreed schedule until either party provides notice to terminate.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Cancellation by Client:</strong></p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
<li>More than 48 hours' notice: No charge</li>
<li>24-48 hours' notice: 50% of service fee</li>
<li>Less than 24 hours' notice: Full service fee</li>
<li>Regular clients: First cancellation per year is free with 24 hours' notice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.3 Cancellation by Us:</strong> We may cancel or reschedule if staff illness, emergencies, or unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending. We'll provide as much notice as possible and arrange an alternative date at no extra charge.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Rescheduling:</strong> You may reschedule appointments with at least 48 hours' notice without charge. Late rescheduling requests are subject to the cancellation fees above.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="space-y-4 text-body text-grey-700">

<p><strong>4.1 Property Access:</strong> You must provide safe, legal access to the property at the agreed time. This may include keys, access codes, or being present. If access is not provided, the visit will be treated as a late cancellation.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Security:</strong> We take property security seriously. Keys and access codes are stored securely and only used by assigned, vetted staff. We log all access for your peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Utilities:</strong> You must ensure water, electricity, and heating (where needed) are available and functioning. If utilities are unavailable, we may need to reschedule.</p>
